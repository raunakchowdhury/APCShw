Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"

- Ooh, Neil deGrasse Tyson
- The introduction to all the planets and other objects inside the Solar System is very interesting
- It's really interesting how Tyson goes from small to big - he starts on Earth, before expanding further and further. Perhaps this is what is meant by "expanding our horizons"
- The rendition of the Observable Universe as a purple, strand-like network is breathtaking. It puts into perspective the adage "we are but a speck in the cosmos"
- The visualization of the Multiverse Hypothesis is also extremely cool. It's something that has captivated me for a while.
- GALILEO!? Never mind it's a dude named Bruno
- The animation is a very useful tool to understand the depth of the descriptions given
- Tyson's analogy of the Inquisition to the "Thought Police" is very astute.
- The characterization of the Church reveals the conservative bastion that it was - unrelenting to change, quick to excommunicate those who disagreed. One can even say
- The reference to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is also appreciated.
- The portrayal of the Church as a political machine is synonymous with the portrayals I've seen in history class.
- NOW IT'S GALILEO
- The visualization of the lifetime of the Universe as a single year really helps one to understand the scope and immensity of the Universe
- The special effects give a very nice visual to the formation of the Earth and Moon
- Best quote so far: "We owe a lot to these microbes...oh yeah, they also invented one more thing. Sex."
- Equal parts large and small: "If that asteroid that took out the dinosaurs hadn't been nudged an inch, we might not have been here"
- Intelligent life is brought into question here: our world has gone through a bit too many coincidences to reach its present state. What does this say about intelligent life on other planets?
- This just went from an introduction to the cosmos to a crash course on human history
- Hammurabi's Code just made an appearance - a nod to the olden times
- Tyson's last quote was awe-inspiring: it touches on humanity's innate drive to seek more.
- This video, as a whole, puts into scope all that we have discovered and how much more that there is to discover.
- One recurring motif within the video was that all that we know about space was the product of science over four centuries. In doing so, it feels as though the video is asking an unspoken question: if it took this little time to discern this much, how long would it be before we understand the inner workings of the Universe?

Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"
@-------------------------------------------------

- It was interesting to see the span of human history and how different civilizations from different parts of the world seem to reach similar conclusions. Almost all people who saw a comet saw it as an omen of bad fortunes.
- The fact that many civilizations looked at the same group of stars and saw many different sets of constellations was really interesting.
- Clearly the people fear the unknown and fill in missing and unexplainable information with some greater being we will never understand. Knowledge is what clears the fog and explains what we fear.
- We thought that the stars were sending us a personal message since we didn't have anything back then. Similar to how we believed we were the center of the universe.
- The visuals of how large the universe is and how we are a tiny part of it shows the bigger scheme of things and how little we are in comparison.
- Interesting comment about how we remember the names of mass murderers but don't know the name of Jan Oort. What does this say about us as a people?
- The representation of the death and the plague was representative of the fears at the time. Really emphasizes the curiosity of Halley and Newton who adventured into discovering the truth on comets.
- Why do we fear the unknown and what compels the few people who face the fear to obtain knowledge?
- Halley found and predicted the course of a comet which was 	widely accepted as the sign of death and famine.
- How does perspective change the way the information is presented? For example, we are taught that Newton is the father of physics but in the video, we receive a view of how he was lost and Halley pushed him to present his work. We also get the relationship between Hooke and Newton that is not emphasized in other works.
- Interesting how coffee shops in the 17th century were places to congress in democracy. It seems cool to think of all the people we see as great congressed in a coffee shop.
- Hooke seems to be portrayed as smart and intellectual but lacking as a human being when he tries to get credit for work over and over again.
- An example of how we forget about the negatives of a person and only remember the great things they have done. Similar to people who 	believe music was the best in the 80's.
- The fact that space travel was a sign of us breaking free from our bonds on Earth was a new way to look at it.
- Halley was one of the first to attempt a prophecy of the comet that wasn't about it causing destruction. The specific prediction turned out to be correct.
