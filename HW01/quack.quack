My most riveting adventure with my ducky was programming the InsertionSort algorithm. I was with a piece of paper, scribbling furiously and crossing out large chunks of symbols and flowcharts. I kept asking questions to my duck, who replied with, “Quack.” My friends at the Dojo looked at me like I was a lunatic, but my duck kept me from getting distracted by them with his reassuring quacks. I hastened to find a solution to a seemingly impossible problem — ‘how do I solve this?’ I wondered. The world was drowned out in a mass of scribbling and quacking. Finally, something clicked. I tried multiple test cases, and the algorithm worked. Lock Ness issued happy quacks in jubilance. Shaking like a Stuyvesant student who has had too much caffeine, I typed in the mess of code and English into my editor, Atom (Atom > emacs). IT worked! I pumped my fist into the air amidst a cacophony of quacks, shouts by sensei Jack to calm down, and my own cry of delight. It was done!
