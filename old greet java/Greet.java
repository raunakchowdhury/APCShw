/* In all three programming languages, some sort of print statement is used in order to output the string "Hello World" to the shell/IDLE/command prompt. In Java, the print statement seems to be "System.out.println", while Python uses "print" and Scheme uses "display." 

   There is a non-syntax based difference here; the code above when run will print out "No hablo queso" without having to include an additional statement that calls the code block. In both Scheme and Python, after writing the "Hello World" function, both programs require an additional line calling the function in order to output "Hello World." */
